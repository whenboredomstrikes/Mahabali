                    Mahabali was, thus, immune from death. After many wars, the invincible Bali had conquered heaven and
                    earth. The suras (devas) approached Vishnu to save them from complete obliteration. Vishnu refused
                    to join the war, or outright kill his own devotee Mahabali. To restore the natural order, he
                    incarnated as the dwarf Brahmin avatar, Vamana. While Mahabali was performing the ashvamedha
                    sacrifice to celebrate his victories and giving away gifts to everyone, Vamana approached him and
                    requested "three steps of land".

                    <img class="v2" src="assets/v-2.webp" alt="">

                    Mahabali granted him this gift, despite warnings from Shukra, who had realised Vamana's true
                    identity. Vamana then metamorphosed into Vishnu's colossal trivikrama form, the first foot
                    encompassing all of heaven in one step and the earth with the second foot. When rhetorically asked
                    where he might take his promised third step, Mahabali accepted his fate and offered his own head.
                    Some Hindu texts state that Mahabali was banished to patala. , some state he was dragged there by
                    Garuda, in others he entered heaven with the touch of Vishnu, while another version states he became
                    Chiranjivi. Others even have Bali admitted into Vaikunta, which was an even higher
                    place than the realm of the devas.According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu granted Bali a boon whereby
                    he could return back to his homeland once every year. The harvest festivals of Balipratipada and
                    Onam are celebrated to mark his yearly homecoming.Literature and inscriptions in Hindu
                    temples suggest that these festivals, featuring colourful decorations, lighted lamps, gift giving,
                    feasts and community events, have been popular in India for more than a millennium. Bali is
                    also featured in the Ramayana where Ravana tries to free him from Patala, but is unable to
